    "Public key encryption allows people to send and receive information in public with little chance anyone who intercepts that information will be able to decipher it. This is done through the use of 'keys' which are used to encode and decode the information being sent. One type of encryption is RSA encryption (an acronym based on the last names of those who developed the public version of it: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), which uses two public keys, known as n and e, and a private key, known as d, to transmit encrypted information. Using the public and private keys, senders and receivers are able to encode and decode this information, while the encrypted information will be hard for anyone who intercepts it to unlock.\n",

This worked fine when the values were small, but then I went to decode a message and 45 minutes later it was still decoding. I thought, \"There has to be a faster way to do this!\" Then I looked at the code to see what I was doing, and realized it was the slow form of FME. It was then I realized that I had not used FME up until that point, and that calling FME might be a good idea! After that, everything worked just fine. And a lot quicker!"

I ran it a second time and got the result the same result. I know I went to the extreme first, and I knew it would be faster, but I didn’t think it would finish instantly.\n",

But when the exponent increases to 100000000, fme is 68945 times faster than FakeFME!!! What’s even more amazing is the exponent I mentioned in the beginning of this, 20481091823 was still calculated using fme in the same amount of time it took to calculate a four-digit exponent. I can’t quantify how much fast fme was because, after 45 minutes, I chose not to let FakeFME finish.\n"
