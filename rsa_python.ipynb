    "Public key encryption allows people to send and receive information in public with little chance anyone who intercepts that information will be able to decipher it. This is done through the use of 'keys' which are used to encode and decode the information being sent. One type of encryption is RSA encryption (an acronym based on the last names of those who developed the public version of it: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), which uses two public keys, known as n and e, and a private key, known as d, to transmit encrypted information. Using the public and private keys, senders and receivers are able to encode and decode this information, while the encrypted information will be hard for anyone who intercepts it to unlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I have learned while doing this project is that cracking RSA encryption is not as easy as it seems, at least from a brute-force standpoint. Up until a certain point you will be able to factor numbers rather easily. But once you cross the threshold into larger numbers, the amount of time needed to factor a number grows very, very quickly.\n",

    "I also learned to make sure to utilize all functions written in order to execute the program. At one point I was brute force encoding and decoding. It worked fine for smaller numbers, but the it started to lag. This was when I realized I was not even using my FME function at all. (This function will be explained in detail below.) Note to self: if you write code to do something, make sure you actually call that code! Now on to the project itself.\n",

I am a first-semester computer science student, and in three weeks I’ve coded a fully functioning RSA program without using any custom cryptography library. To me that is 100-point worthy in and of itself. But the project demanded more, so I did more.\n",

I really wanted to do something related to why the most common e is 65,537, but that would have been a research paper and not a coding project. I wanted to add one more thing to make the process simpler. I got my idea when it came to the code breaking portion of the project.\n",

So why not take the extra portion to automate the picking of these numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding the Sieve of Erastosthenes was not easy. I had a general idea but kept messing up the implementation. It was when I finally added two lists to my function that I could manipulate that I got it to work. I chose values in the range of 3 – 10,000 so the function would always be able to return a tuple of relative primes, and so it would compute them rather quickly. (Up to 100,000 did not take terribly long, under one minute, but it still took much longer than 10,000.) Having two four-digit values also allowed for very big potential values for n, so I think these extra functions would provide value to the user looking to encrypt. While the input function doesn’t do much mathematically, I think it makes for a better-looking end product.\n",

The RSA was challenging enough, but I wanted the opportunity for full credit, so I made the extra functions using material that was covered in class that I think makes for a better final product.\n",

    "All of this is why I think I deserve the full 15 points. I made an RSA program that works, and then I made that program better by helping the user chose the initial values that set everything in motion."
